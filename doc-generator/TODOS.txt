1) Verify how we're getting the locations for "Required Profiles."
   Currently, the URI is built based on the repo, profile name, and
   version string (which we coerce to v1.0.0 format). (And we look for
   a partial URL override to get a local file.) Jeff indicated that it
   would be desirable to look at what's available at the specified URI
   or local directory and choose the latest version of the profile,
   provided it meets the Minimum Version requirement.

   This would require that we allow directory indexing of the profiles
   at their ultimate location, or that there's an API for getting the
   available versions.



A) Before Actions were established in the json schemas, we supported
   including Action Details in the supplemental document. Should we
   remove that support now?
