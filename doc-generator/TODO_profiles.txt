===============
Incorporate all examples from the documentation in SampleProfileExtended.json


===============
Schema-level properties

X Repository: use this; build a schema_ref from it to index in-memory profile data.

ReadRequirement, ConditionalRequirements -- may need an example of
these & how they should appear. Currently they are just ignored.

===============
Property-level requirements:

X ReadRequirement: default is Mandatory
X WriteRequirement: default is None (we don't want to display this, so no need to set a value)

X ConditionalRequirements

? Can SubordinateToResource and Compare be combined in the same
  Conditional Req? I'm combining with "and" if it comes up.

MinSupportValues

X Comparison (So many possible values!)

X Values

    ===============
?   Comparison question for Jeff: In the Power example, PowerSupplyType has a ReadRequirement of "AnyOf".
    That's supposed to be a Comparison, not a ReadRequirement, right?


===============
X Action Requirements

X Purpose (maybe already handled?)

    ===============
X    Parameter requirements

===============
Registry level requirements

===============
RequiredProfiles (top level): need to resolve these and merge them in.



===============
Top-level properties: include more of these in the output (intro)? Ask Jeff.

===============
Profile requirements: output them? Ask Jeff.

===============
Protocol Requirements -- capture and output.
