I took a stab at the subset document – there is definitely overlap
with the Profile definition, but it’s certainly simpler to use just
the stuff we need in the proper context.  We could consider adding
these structures to the “content_supplement” instead of another file?
Because that is essentially what it is – a way to add/remove content.
If we go that route, perhaps some further restructure of that to move
the text there now to a “description” or “propertyDetails” property?

So I made some examples that I think cover the cases I need – and
these are all “real” from schema:

* Circuit:  Include everything from v1.1 (but nothing from v1.2+)
* Facility: Only include the three properties: AmbientMetrics, EnvironemntMetrics, FacilityType (all enums are supported)
* Outlet: Include everything from latest schema version
  * OutletType supports only these enums…
  * Do NOT include “IndicatorLED”
  * Do NOT include “ResetMetrics” action
  * “Powercontrol” action supports “PowerState” parameter and the “on”/”off” enums
* ComputerSystem: Include everything from v1.8 (nothing from v1.9+)
* ServiceRoot: Include everything from latest version


And the overall goal is to minimize the amount of work for the authors
– the more of Redfish you support, the less you have to call out here
to tailor to your implementation…

Think about the inclusion in content_supplement – if we just lose the
ability to add text blocks there, I can live with that, too – it’s
unlikely that we would be using this method to add “small amounts of
text” – either big blocks or why would we bother!


==================================================
Amy recasts:

- Document only schemas listed in IncludeSchemas
- Each schema may specify:
  - Version: include everything from this version
  - Baseline: boolean, if true, include everything except as noted. If false, include only what is noted. Default is true.
  - Properties and Actions: specify specific properties to treat differently from Baseline:
    - "Include": false indicates property/action should be omitted.
    - If no content for a property/action, include it (respecting schema Version if set). E.g., "Include": true is default.
    - SupportedValues: (for enums), limit supported values.
    - PropertyDetails: ask Jeff what he was going for here.
    - Object properties (actions) may have Properties.
