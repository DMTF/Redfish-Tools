# Overview

The Redfish standard comprises a set of specifications maintained by the Redfish Forum, a working group within the DMTF. The standard defines a protocol that uses RESTful interfaces to provide access to data and operations associated with the management of systems and networks. One of the strengths of the Redfish protocol is that it works with a wide range of servers: from stand-alone servers to rack-mount and bladed environments to large-scale data centers and cloud environments.

The Redfish standard addresses several key issues for infrastructures that require scalability. Large infrastructures often consist of many simple servers of different makes and types. This hyperscale usage model requires a new approach to systems management. The Redfish Scalable Platforms Management ("Redfish") protocol addresses these needs by providing a standard protocol based on out-of-band systems management.

With the above goals in mind, the Redfish protocol was designed as an open industry standard to meet scalability requirements in multivendor deployments. It easily integrates with commonly used tools, using RESTful interfaces to perform operations and using JSON and OData formats for data payloads.

# Using this guide

Every Redfish API response consists of a JSON payload containing properties that are strictly defined by a schema for that resource.  The schema defining a particular resource can be determined from the value of the "@odata.type" property returned in every Redfish response.  This guide details the definitions for every Redfish standard schema.

Each schema section contains:

* The name, current version and description of the schema.
* A listing of the possible URIs where resources defined by this schema can appear in a Redfish Service (v1.6 or later). See [URI listings](#uri-listings) below for more information.
* A table defining each property with additional details for those properties when needed.
* A listing of the available Actions defined for the schema.
* An example JSON payload for a resource using the schema.

<br>
The property-level details include:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Property Name | The name of the JSON property as it will appear (case sensitive) in the JSON payload.  For properties added to the schema after the initial release (v1.0.0), the version that the property was added will be shown in parenthesis.  Properties that have been deprecated will also be indicated (along with the version where the deprecation occurred). |
| Type | The JSON data type(s) for the property.  This can include boolean, number, string or object. String types that use defined enumerations will state "(enum)".  Number types will state their units where used. |
| Attributes | Designates whether the property is read-only or read-write (if supported by the implementation), and whether a 'null' value may be returned by the Service if the value of the property is temporarily unavailable. |
| Description | The description of the property, as copied directly from the schema 'Description' definition. |

## URI listings

The Redfish Specification v1.6.0 added mandatory support for the OpenAPI Specification v3.0.  As part of this support, the URIs for every Redfish Resource are defined to appear at known, fixed locations. Resource Collections also appear at fixed locations, with the Members of each collection appearing at URIs constructed using a fixed path structure, with appropriate path segments equal to the value of "Id" properties of Members along the path.

Support for v1.6.0 and OpenAPI can be determined by comparing the value of the "RedfishVersion" property in the Service Root (\redfish\v1\).  Services reporting a value of "1.6.0" or higher (such as "1.6.1" or "1.7.0") adhere to the URI definitions shown.

The URI listings do not apply to Redfish Services reporting support of Specification versions prior to v1.6.0.  For those Services, clients must utilize the hypermedia features of the API to discover links from the Service Root to each resource.  While Services will typically match the URIs listed in this documents for many of their resources, this is not guaranteed and will result in errors.


# Common properties

## Properties defined for all Redfish schemas

The following properties are defined for inclusion in every Redfish schema, and therefore may be encountered in any Response payload.  They are documented here to avoid repetition in the Reference Guide property tables.  Note that several of these properties are payload annotations, but are listed here as they are required for all Redfish resources.

#include_fragment ./docs/DSP2046/CommonPropertySchema.json#/definitions/CommonProperties/properties

## Frequently used properites

In addition, the following properties are frequently defined in Redfish schemas.  Their definition and usage is the same throughout the Redfish data model.

#include_fragment ./docs/DSP2046/CommonPropertySchema.json#/definitions/FrequentProperties/properties

## Payload annotations

Payload annotations are a mechanism in which a service provides additional information about a given property or object.  Redfish limits usage of these annotations to OData core terms, Redfish Extensions or Redfish Messages.

### Property-level annotations

A payload annotation for a single property takes the form of an additional property named `Property@Schema.Term`, where `Property` is the JSON property being annotated, `Schema` is the schema file where the definition for the annotation is found, and `Term` is the name of the Annotation.

| Term                       | Usage |
| ----                       | ----- |
| `@Redfish.AllowableValues` | Indicates to the client the different string values the service accepts for a given action parameter |
| `@Message.ExtendedInfo`    | Allows the service to provide a set of Message structures for a given property to indicate additional information; this can be useful when a property is `null` due to an error condition, and the service wants to convey why the property is `null` |
| `@odata.count`             | Can be used on properties that are arrays in order to indicate their size so that a client does not need to count the array members |

In the example below, the property `ResetType` is being annotated with the `AllowableValues` term, which is defined in the `Redfish` schema (an alias for RedfishExtensions).  This is used to indicate to the client that the service supports the values `On` and `ForceOff` for `ResetType`.

```json
{
    "ResetType@Redfish.AllowableValues": [
        "On",
        "ForceOff"
    ],
    ...
}
```


### Resource or object-level annotations

A payload annotation for an entire resource or a JSON object takes the form of `@Schema.Term`, where `Namespace` is the schema file where the definition is found and `Term` is the name of the Annotation.  These payload annotations are used to provide further information about the object itself.

| Term                    | Usage |
| ----                    | ----- |
| `@Redfish.Settings`     | Gives the client a reference to the resource that represents the future property settings to be applied to this object |
| `@Redfish.ActionInfo`   | Used on actions to provide the client a reference to an ActionInfo resource, which gives detailed information about a given action's parameters |
| `@Message.ExtendedInfo` | Allows the service to provide a set of Message structures for a given object to indicate additional information; this can be useful when an error condition is reached, and the service wants to convey what error was encountered |
| `@odata.id`             | Provides the unique URI for a given resource |
| `@odata.type`           | Provides the type definition of the object in the format of `#Namespace.Type`, where `Namespace` is the Namespace in the CSDL file where the definition is found and `Type` is the name of the ComplexType or EntityType element found in the Namespace |
| `@odata.context`        | Provides an OData client with a descriptor for the content of the payload; in Redfish, this is simply always going to be `/redfish/v1/$metadata#Namespace.Entity`, where `Namespace` is the unversioned Namespace in the CSDL file where the definition is found and `Entity` is the name of the EntityType element being used |

In the example below, the object is being annotated with the `ActionInfo` term, which is defined in the `Redfish` schema (an alias for RedfishExtensions).  This is used to indicate to the client that it can find more information about the given action, in this case `#ComputerSystem.Reset`, at the URI `/redfish/v1/Systems/1/ResetActionInfo`.

```json
{
    "#ComputerSystem.Reset": {
        "target": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/Actions/ComputerSystem.Reset",
        "@Redfish.ActionInfo": "/redfish/v1/Systems/1/ResetActionInfo"
    },
    ...
}
```

# Common objects

The following JSON objects are frequently defined in Redfish schemas.  Like the individual common propoerties listed above, these objects share a common definition which is shown here to avoid repetition in teh Reference Guide property tables.

# Resource collections

A core concept in Redfish is a Collection of resources.  A Collection is a group of like resources where the number of instances in the group can shrink or grow depending on the scope of the Redfish Service or the configuration of the devices being managed. Every Resource Collection resource has the same set of supported properties, and all contain "Collection" in the name of their schema.  Every resource linked in the "Members" array within a Resource Collection will have the same resource type (same schema with the same major version, but can vary in minor or errata schema versions, which are all compatible).

The properties of a Resource Collection are as follows:

#include_fragment ./docs/DSP2046/CommonPropertySchema.json#/definitions/Collection/properties

As shown in the example below, a Redfish Service may provide management functionality for several Computer Systems, and therefore a ComputerSystemCollection resource is provided.  This example shows a Service with four ComputerSystem instances ("Members").

~~~json
{
    "@odata.type": "#ComputerSystemCollection.ComputerSystemCollection",
    "Name": "Computer System Collection",
    "Members@odata.count": 4,
    "Members": [
        {
            "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/529QB9450R6"
        },
        {
            "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/529QB9451R6"
        },
        {
            "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/529QB9452R6"
        },
        {
            "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems/529QB9453R6"
        }
    ],
    "@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#ComputerSystemCollection.ComputerSystemCollection",
    "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Systems"
}

~~~

## Resource Collection URIs (Redfish v1.6+)

The following table lists all of the Redfish-defined Resource Collections and the URIs where they can appear.  NOTE: The URIs listed are valid for Redfish Services conforming to the Redfish Specification v1.6.0 or higher.  Services built on earlier versions of the Specification may use different URIs which must be discovered by following the links from the Service Root (/redfish/v1/).
