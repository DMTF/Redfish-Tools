# Redfish documentation generator

This document was created using the Redfish Documentation Generator utility, which uses the contents of the Redfish schema files (in JSON schema format) to automatically generate the bulk of the text.  The source code for the utility is available for download at the DMTF's Github repository located at <a href="http://www.github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Tools">http://www.github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Tools</a>.
