      <h3>Primary Schema Files</h3>

      <p>The following files are the primary schemas defined for JSON resources conforming to the Redfish Specification.  Each schema definition is available in both CSDL (XML) and json-schema formats.  A .ZIP archive (DSP8010) containing all of current schema files (both CSDL and json-schema) can be downloaded from the Redfish Standards page at: <a href="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish">http://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish</a></p>

The properties are common to all user accounts, such as password requirements, and control features such as account lockout. The schema also contains links to the collections of Manager Accounts and Roles.</td> </tr>

Parameter support can differ between vendors and even between instances of a resource. This data can be used to ensure Action requests from applications contain supported parameters.</td> </tr>
