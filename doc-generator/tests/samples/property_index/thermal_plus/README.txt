This example consists of the Thermal schema plus supporting
schemas, with some properties deleted so there's no need to traverse
further.

The Thermal schema (as of this excerpt) contains some examples that
should be detected as exceptions -- differing types for the same property name. A
FanName property has already been added to create a case of the same
property appearing with matching type but differing description.
