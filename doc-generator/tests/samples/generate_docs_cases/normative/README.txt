This example consists of the NetworkPort schema plus supporting
schemas, with some properties deleted so there's no need to traverse
further. In addition, some properties have been cobbled together to
illustrate specific features of normative output.

Note that the "expected output" may not reflect what we'd want in
"typical output," because the configuration used is minimal. For a
specific example, this output does not exclude Collections.
