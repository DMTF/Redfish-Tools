In the Manager schema, there are two properties named
"ConnectTypesSupported." One is within GraphicalConsole and the other
within CommandShell, and they have distinct definitions.

Previous versions of the doc generator assumed that a property name
was unique within a schema, and would expand just one of these
ConnectTypesSupported properties in the "Property details"
section. They should both appear, with distinct headings.
